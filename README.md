# Fetch-DogAPI

## Project Highlights
DogFetcher is a front-end web app that allows users to generate a gallery of dogs from their favorite breeds or by random breeds with [Dog API](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/).

## Planning

Check out this project's [https://www.figma.com/design/h7RYyAKIq1BcotroGtpkKC/Untitled?node-id=0-1&t=N0ZVW3NU1QjGj22G-1](Figma)!

This project was incredibly fun to take on especially with the variety of images of adorable dogs during the development of this webapp.
Currently, Dog Fetcher is a simple front-end web app. For future growth of this web app, I would like to explore more libraries for styling to improve user interactions. To expand upon the front end, I plan to implement a backend which allows users to save images to a community favorites page.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

Check out [Dog Fetcher](https://tiffany-zhu5303.github.io/Fetch-DogAPI/) hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
Note: for a smoother user experience - avoid refreshing the page unless it is on the route /Fetch-DogAPI/

## Getting Started Locally

In your terminal:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
```
git clone https://github.com/Tiffany-Zhu5303/Fetch-DogAPI.git TiffanyZhuDogFetcher

2. Open project repository
```
cd TiffanyZhuDogFetcher
```
3. Install project dependencies

4. Run the webapp!

This will run the webapp on [http://localhost:3000/Fetch-DogAPI](http://localhost:3000) if port 3000 is available.
The page will reload when you make changes.
